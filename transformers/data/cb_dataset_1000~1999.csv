2131,okay . that's good to hear . what do you think about $5000 even for it . of course you know that you priced it a bit high . ,init-price

2184,"it all sounds so lovely , anyway you can waive the pet fee if i do it at 2100 ? ",counter-price

2186,i only have one cat . . no way you can do 2100 ? ,insist
